# Score Prediction: Supervised Machine Learning - The grip rotational internship tasks

## Situation:
The aim of this project was to predict student scores based on the number of hours studied. The data was obtained from an external source, a CSV file hosted on GitHub.

## Task:
The project was divided into several tasks. The first task involved loading the data into a Pandas dataframe and performing data cleaning, which involved checking for missing data and duplicates. The second task involved data visualization and linearity checks, which involved creating a scatter plot to check for linearity between the predictor and the target variable. The third task involved splitting the data into training and test sets, building a linear regression model, and evaluating its accuracy. Finally, the model was used to make predictions on a new set of data.

## Action:
- To carry out this project, I used Python and several libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy, and Sklearn. I loaded the CSV file using Pandas and then performed some initial data cleaning, which included checking for missing data, duplicates, and a statistical description of the data. 
- I then visualized the data using a scatter plot to check for linearity between the predictor variable (hours studied) and the target variable (scores). 
- Next, I split the data into training and test sets and created a linear regression model using the Sklearn library. The model's accuracy was evaluated using the r2 score metric. Finally, the model was used to predict scores for a new set of data.

### Linearity Check

## Results:
The project was successful in predicting student scores based on the number of hours studied. The scatter plot showed a linear relationship between the predictor and the target variable. The model achieved a high level of accuracy, as evidenced by the high r2 score. The model was able to predict the score for a new set of data with good accuracy.


## Tools used:
The following tools and libraries were used to carry out this project: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy, and Sklearn. Pandas was used to load and clean the data, while Numpy was used to perform mathematical operations on the data. Seaborn and Matplotlib were used to create visualizations of the data, such as scatter plots, and histograms. Scipy was used to perform statistical analyses of the data, such as the r2 score. Sklearn was used to split the data into training and test sets, build a linear regression model, and evaluate the model's accuracy.
